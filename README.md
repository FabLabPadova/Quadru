# Quadru
Quadru is a generic quadrubot's implementation.

# What are we using?
Fablab Padova constantly holds Arduino's courses which expands a hefty community named "Ardulab Community".
Therefore, we use all kind of Arduino and some awesome modules as regards elettronic parts.
3D printer helps us to create quadrubot's anatomy.

# Our Purpose
Ardulab Community wants to improve step by step Quadru project and we have no limit! But we have some important objectives too:

- Quadru stability, it needs to be stable;
- Quadru walking;
- Quadru running -> this is the greatest thing we long for!
